# dotfiles

![][license_badge]

Since I use both Mac and GNU/Linux, the commands/functions/aliases for each platform are different. Earlier I kept the dotfiles in 2 separate folder here (osx, linux), but I have merged them now to be able to use the same set of files on all computers. You'll notice a few if statements throughout the files, like:

```bash
[[ ${__DARWIN__} ]] && ...
[[ ${__LINUX__} ]] && ...
etc.
```

To clean up the home folderâ€¦ Except the standard bash files, the additional bash files are located in: `~/.bash.d/<file>`. To load them - just add the name into the `bash_files` array:

```bash
# Example
bash_files=( ruby aliases functions git cheat adb venv );
```

Some of the content _(functions/aliases)_ are sometimes being removed and moved to their own scripts instead. You'll most likely find those scripts in the [junkyard][jy].


## .config files

I've added a few of my files/settings to the `.config` folder. Mostly so I can download them my self, when on a new computer.
